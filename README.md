##### Questions
<br> 1. Choose one dataset (audi, ford, hyundai, toyota, skoda, vw) from this link: https://github.com/SKawsar/Data_Visualization_with_Python
<br> Original data source: https://www.kaggle.com/aishwaryamuthukumar/cars-dataset-audi-bmw-ford-hyundai-skoda-vw
<br> 2. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using groupby/pivot_table and barplot (total 9 barplots), based on model, transmission, and fuelType,
<br> A. What are the top 5 selling car models/transmission/fuelType in the dataset?
<br> B. What's the average selling price of the top 5 selling car models/transmission/fuelType?
<br> C. What's the total sale of the top 5 selling car models/transmission/fuelType?

<br> 3. If you participated in module 2, you can perform your analysis in the same repository/.ipynb file you used for module 2.
<br> 4. Code must be submitted through GitHub. Attach a direct link to your repository. Example repository name: bmw_used_car_analysis, toyota_used_car_analysis etc. The name of the repository shouldn't be hw3, HW3, emk_HW3 or similar. Example Notebook name: bmw_used_car_EDA.ipynb, audi_used_car_EDA.ipynb etc. EDA means Exploratory Data Analysis. Proper naming is important for a good GitHub profile. Hiring managers/Recruiters look for an organized GitHub profile. 
<br> 5. Please run all cells before you upload/push your code on GitHub. Check YouTube if you don't know how to share code through Github.
<br> 6. Use the Markdown cell for proper commenting and make sure the code is easily understandable. Use the .head() or .tail() method when necessary rather than displaying all the rows in the dataframe.
<br> 7. Make sure your code is reusable and reproducible.
